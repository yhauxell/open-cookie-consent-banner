# Internal Documentation

This directory contains internal strategy, competitive analysis, and detailed planning documents.

## Why Separate?

While we believe in transparency, some documents contain:
- Detailed competitive analysis
- Internal metrics and goals  
- Marketing strategies
- Sensitive positioning information

These documents are kept in this directory to:
- Keep internal planning separate from public roadmap
- Avoid setting unrealistic public expectations
- Maintain flexibility in strategy execution
- Protect competitive advantages

## Public Alternatives

For public-facing information, see:
- **[ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md)** - High-level feature roadmap (public)
- **[README.md](../../README.md)** - Project overview
- **[docs/](../../docs/)** - Public documentation

## Access

These documents are tracked in git and available to anyone who clones the repository. They're simply not prominently linked to keep the public-facing documentation clean and focused.
